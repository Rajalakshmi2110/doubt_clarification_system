IEEE 802.3 10-Mbps Specifications (Ethernet)\nThe IEEE 802.3 committee has defined a number of alternative physical configura-\ntions.This is both good and bad.\\n\\nWe’ll see several different\nframe formats when we examine specific link-layer protocols in the\nsecond half of this chapter. Link access. A medium access control (MAC) protocol specifies the\nrules by which a frame is transmitted onto the link.\\n\\nAs shown in Figure 6.27, the 802.1Q frame consists of the standard\nEthernet frame with a four-byte VLAN tag added into the header that\ncarries the identity of the VLAN to which the frame belongs. The VLAN\ntag is added into a frame by the switch at the sending side of a VLAN trunk,\nparsed, and removed by the switch at the receiving side of the trunk.\n\n[INSTRUCTION]\nAnswer the question academically using only the given context.", "output": "The IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet) frame consists of the following sequential fields: Preamble (7 octets): Alternating 0s and 1s to synchronize the receiver's clock.

As with Ethernet’s CSMA/CD, the “CSMA” in\nCSMA/CA stands for “carrier sense multiple access,” meaning that each\nstation senses the channel before transmitting, and refrains from\ntransmitting when the channel is sensed busy.\\n\\nThe foregoing observations led to the development of carrier sense multiple\naccess (CSMA). With CSMA, a station wishing to transmit first listens to the\nmedium to determine if another transmission is in progress (carrier sense). If the\nmedium is in use, the station must wait. If the medium is idle, the station may trans-\nmit.\\n\\nPrecursors CSMA/CD and its precursors can be termed random access, or con-\ntention, techniques.They are random access in the sense that there is no predictable\nor scheduled time for any station to transmit; station transmissions are ordered ran-\ndomly. They exhibit contention in the sense that stations contend for time on the\nshared medium.\\n\\nExplain the three persistence protocols that can be used with CSMA. What is CSMA/CD? Explain binary exponential backoff. What are the transmission medium options for Fast Ethernet? How does Fast Ethernet differ from 10BASE-T, other than the data rate? In the context of Ethernet, what is full-duplex operation?

Link-state routing is designed to overcome the drawbacks of distance-vector\nrouting. When a router is initialized, it determines the link cost on each of its net-\nwork interfaces.\\n\\nThe link-state routing application interacts with the link-state manager\nto get updated link state; it might also consult other components in the\nstate-­management layer. It then computes the new least-cost paths. 5. The link-state routing application then interacts with the flow table\nmanager, which determines the flow tables to be updated. 6.\\n\\nOur discussion of link-state routing has implicitly assumed that link weights are set, a\nrouting algorithm such as OSPF is run, and traffic flows according to the routing tables\ncomputed by the LS algorithm. In terms of cause and effect, the link weights are given (i.e.,\nthey come first) and result (via Dijkstra’s algorithm) in routing paths that minimize overall\ncost.\\n\\nWe can think\nof routing as the process of planning the trip from Pennsylvania to Florida:\nBefore embarking on the trip, the driver has consulted a map and chosen\none of many paths possible, with each path consisting of a series of road\nsegments connected at interchanges. A key element in every network router is its forwarding table.\n\n[INSTRUCTION]\nAnswer the question academically using only the given context.", "output": "Each router broadcasts the status of its **directly connected links** to all other routers, allowing everyone to build a complete network map.", "metadata": {"question_id": 72, "topic": "Computer Networks", "difficulty": "medium", "retrieved_chunks": 4, "source_dataset": "data\\dataset\\maximum_questions.json"}}\n{"input": "[QUESTION]\nExplain \"Fault Isolation.\"\n\n[CONTEXT]\nRobustness has to do with the ability of the network to deliver packets via some route\nin the face of localized failures and overloads.Ideally,the network can react to such con-\ntingencies without the loss of packets or the breaking of virtual circuits.

For example, some link-layer\nprotocols provide reliable delivery, from transmitting node, over one link, to\nreceiving node.\\n\\nIn a similar manner,\nthe services that a transport protocol can provide are often constrained by\nthe service model of the underlying network-layer protocol.\\n\\n(For example, the train offers downtown pickup and\ndrop-off, whereas the plane offers shorter travel time.)\nWhat are the services that a transport-layer protocol can offer to\napplications invoking it?\n\n[INSTRUCTION]\nAnswer the question academically using only the given context.", "output": "Providing similar services (like error control) in both layers is necessary due to the end-to-end principle.

Thus, the transport layer must provide a comprehensive end-to-end check to ensure all data actually reached the final application intact.", "metadata": {"question_id": 15, "topic": "Protocol Layers", "difficulty": "medium", "retrieved_chunks": 4, "source_dataset": "data\\dataset\\maximum_questions.json"}}\n{"input": "[QUESTION]\nDifferentiate between \"Non-persistent\" and \"Persistent\" HTTP.\n\n[CONTEXT]\nPrior to persistent connections, one separate TCP connection was used to fetch each\nURL.Analyze the advantages of persistent connections over the old HTTP paradigm\nof one connection per data transfer.\\n\\nThis frequent creating and closing of sockets\ncan severely impact the performance of a busy Web server (although a\nnumber of operating system tricks can be used to mitigate the problem).
