MAC address vs. IP address for registration Universities and carriers collect the MAC address because it is a permanent, flat identifier associated with the hardware (the \"social security number\" of the device). In contrast, IP addresses are transient and change whenever a mobile device moves to a new subnet or has its lease expire via DHCP. The MAC address allows the system to identify the specific physical device regardless of its current network location. 19. Silly Window Syndrome (SWS) Silly Window Syndrome is a phenomenon that causes extremely poor performance in TCP when data is exchanged in very small segments. It occurs if the sender transmits data in small chunks or if the receiver advertises small increments in window size (credit) after clearing its buffer, causing the overhead of the headers to become significantly larger than the actual data being transferred. 20. Differentiate between circuit switching and packet switching *   Circuit Switching: Establishes a dedicated communications path with reserved resources (bandwidth and buffers); it provides a guaranteed constant data rate and involves no queuing delay once the circuit is set up. *   Packet Switching: Uses resources on demand without reservation; data is sent in discrete packets that are queued at nodes, which can lead to variable delay or loss, but allows for more efficient sharing of link capacity. *** Analogy for Circuit vs. Packet Switching: Circuit switching is like a reserved seat on a train—you have a dedicated spot for the whole trip, but it's wasted if you don't show up. Packet switching is like a public bus—there is no reserved seat, and you might have to wait at the station if it's crowded, but the bus is used more efficiently by everyone. 21. Class/Type of Specific IP Addresses According to the traditional classful addressing scheme defined in the sources: *   a) 220.24.88.99: This is a Class C address. Class C addresses have a first octet range of 192 to 223. *   b) 6.75.10.68: This is a Class A address. Class A addresses have a first octet range of 1 to 126. 22. Duplicate IP Address Startup Scenario (Host A and B) When Host B starts up after Host A with the same IP address, a conflict occurs within the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) mechanism. Typically, a newly arriving host may send an ARP request to resolve its own IP address to ensure it is unique; if Host B does this, Host A will receive the broadcast and may respond or log an error. If an external host sends an ARP query for that shared IP, both Host A and Host B will respond with their respective (different) MAC addresses. This leads to inconsistent ARP tables in other network nodes, a situation where the \"winning\" MAC address in a remote cache depends on which response arrived last, effectively disrupting reliable communication for both hosts. 23. Salient Features of IPv6 The sources identify several key enhancements in IPv6 over IPv4: *   Expanded Addressing: IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses (compared to 32-bit), providing an effectively inexhaustible supply of unique identifiers. *   Streamlined Header: It features a fixed-length 40-byte header with fewer fields (8 vs 12 in IPv4), which allows for faster processing by routers. *   Flow Labeling: A 20-bit field allows a source to label packets for special handling (e.g., real-time service) by routers. *   Improved Options Mechanism: Options are moved to extension headers located between the IP and transport headers, simplifying the main header. *   No Router Fragmentation: IPv6 prohibits fragmentation at intermediate routers; it must be performed by the source host, which increases forwarding efficiency. *   Anycast Addresses: A new type of address that allows a packet to be delivered to the \"nearest\" member of a group of functional interfaces. 24. Three Issues in the Data Link Layer The data link layer must address several fundamental communication challenges: *   Framing: The need to encapsulate network-layer datagrams into distinct link-layer frames with recognizable boundaries. *   Link Access: Coordinating how multiple nodes share a broadcast medium to prevent or manage collisions. *   Error Control: Implementing mechanisms to detect and potentially correct bit errors introduced by signal attenuation or noise. *   Flow Control: Ensuring a fast sender does not overwhelm a slow receiver's buffer capacity. *** Analogy for IPv6 Addressing: If IPv4 addresses were like a small town's filing cabinet where every citizen had a folder, IPv6 would be like giving a unique folder to every single grain of sand on Earth, ensuring we never run out of space to organize new information. ### Unit I: Data Communication and Networking"}]}

CRC Computation *   Message $M(X)$: $X^5 + X^4 + X + 1$ (Binary: 110011). *   Generator $G(X)$: $X^4 + X^3 + 1$ (Binary: 11001). *   Procedure: Multiply $M(X)$ by $X^r$ (where $r=4$ is the degree of $G(X)$) and divide by $G(X)$.     1.

Bring down the remaining 0s: 10000.     5.  10000 / 11001 = 0 with remainder 10000. *   CRC (FCS): The calculated CRC is 10000 (or $X^4$ in polynomial form). 8. Why IEEE 802.11 Frame uses 4 Address Fields The 802.11 frame uses multiple address fields for internetworking purposes. Three fields are typically used in infrastructure mode to indicate the receiver, transmitter, and the router interface (BSS identifier). The fourth address field is specifically required when Access Points (APs) forward frames to each other while operating in ad hoc mode. 9. Why CSMA/CD is Unsuitable for Ad Hoc Networks CSMA/CD is not suitable for wireless ad hoc environments because collision detection is often impossible. The strength of the station's own transmitted signal at the adapter is much higher than any incoming signal, making it difficult to detect interference. Furthermore, even with detection, a station cannot sense all collisions due to the hidden terminal problem (physical obstructions) and signal fading over distance. 10. Subnetting a Class C Network (192.168.1.0 with 255.255.255.240) *   Default Class C Mask: 255.255.255.0 (/24). *   Subnet Mask 240: In binary, 240 is 11110000. *   Subnet Bits: There are 4 bits borrowed from the host portion for subnetting. *   Host Bits: There are 4 bits remaining for host identifiers. *   Number of Networks: $2^4 =$ 16 subnets. *   Number of Hosts per Network: $2^4 - 2 =$ 14 usable hosts (subtracting the network and broadcast addresses). 11. IPv6 Header Size vs. Address Bits While IPv6 addresses are 128 bits (four times larger than the 32-bit IPv4 addresses), the IPv6 header is only 40 bytes, which is not a proportionate increase from the 20-byte IPv4 minimum. The designers achieved this by streamlining the header, reducing the number of fields from 12 in IPv4 to just 8 in IPv6. By moving optional information to extension headers and removing the header checksum to reduce processing time at each hop, the fixed-length header allows for faster processing by routers. 12. Protocols for E-mail with Text and Images *   Application Layer: The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is used to transfer the email between hosts. Because the email contains an image, the MIME (Multi-Purpose Internet Mail Extensions) protocol is required to wrap the non-textual data into a format that SMTP can handle. *   Transport Layer: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is the underlying protocol used by SMTP to ensure the reliable delivery of the mail message. 13. Receiver-Host Functionality of UDP At the receiver host, UDP acts as a simple demultiplexer. It uses the destination port number found in the segment header to deliver the data to the correct intermediary socket for the intended application. It also performs a checksum calculation for error detection; if the calculated checksum does not match the value in the header, the segment is typically discarded. 14. TCP Reliability Mechanisms TCP ensures reliable data transfer over an unreliable network layer using several coordinated mechanisms: *   Checksums to detect bit errors in segments. *   Sequence Numbers to ensure data is reassembled in the proper order and to detect duplicates. *   Acknowledgments (ACKs) and Timers; if a sender does not receive an ACK before the timer expires, it retransmits the data. *   Flow and Congestion Control to regulate the rate of data transmission to prevent overwhelming the receiver or the network. 15. Separating Transport and Network Layers The Transport and Network layers cannot be combined because they have different scopes of communication. The network layer provides host-to-host logical communication (connecting two machines), while the transport layer provides process-to-process logical communication (connecting specific applications running on those machines). This separation allows the transport layer to provide a reliable service even when the underlying network layer is unreliable. 16. Switch vs. Bridge Operations The significant difference lies in performance and implementation. A bridge is typically a two-port device that handles frame processing in software, whereas a layer 2 switch handles address recognition and frame forwarding in hardware. Furthermore, a bridge usually analyzes one frame at a time, while a switch has multiple parallel data paths to handle many frames simultaneously. 17. Data in the \"Pipe\" Calculation The amount of data that fits in the \"pipe\" is determined by the bandwidth-delay product ($Bandwidth \\times RTT$). *   Calculation: $155 \\text{ Mbps} \\times 0.120 \\text{ seconds} = 18.6 \\text{ million bits}$. *   Bytes: $18,600,000 / 8 = \\mathbf{2,325,000 \\text{ bytes}}$. 18. Advantages of Destination-Only Reassembly Performing reassembly only at the ultimate destination rather than at intermediate routers has several benefits: *   It reduces router complexity and speeds up the forwarding process because routers do not need to store and process partial datagrams. *   It allows for dynamic routing, as different fragments of the same datagram can follow different paths through the network. *   It prevents routers from needing large buffers to hold fragments, which would risk memory exhaustion. 19. Network Addresses for Specific IPs Under traditional classful addressing, the network addresses are as follows: *   i. 127.29.12.78: This falls in the 127.0.0.0 range, which is reserved for loopback. *   ii. 159.78.9.10: This is a Class B address (range 128–191). The network address is 159.78.0.0. *   iii. 192.20.10.11: This is a Class C address (range 192–223). The network address is 192.20.10.0. *   iv. 230.23.88.99: This is a Class D address, used for multicast groups, and does not have a traditional network/host split. 20. Similar Services in Data Link and Transport Layers Providing similar services (like error control) in both layers is necessary due to the end-to-end principle. While the data link layer can correct errors locally on a high-error link (like a wireless link) to improve efficiency, it is incomplete because it cannot guarantee delivery if a router between the source and destination crashes or drops a packet due to congestion. Thus, the transport layer must provide a comprehensive end-to-end check to ensure all data actually reached the final application intact. 21. Why FTP uses 2 port numbers? The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) uses two separate TCP connections to handle different tasks efficiently. The first is a control connection used for the exchange of commands and responses, such as user identification, passwords, and file action requests. The second connection is established specifically for the actual data transfer once the transfer has been approved via the control connection. This separation allows control information to be managed independently of the raw data stream. 22. State the significance of SMI in network management. The Structure of Management Information (SMI) is a formal data description language used to define the objects within a Management Information Base (MIB). Its primary significance is ensuring that the syntax and semantics of network management data are unambiguous and well-defined, which allows for interoperability between different management stations and agents from various vendors. It restricts MIB data to simple types, such as scalars and two-dimensional tables, to maintain simplicity and extensibility in the network management framework. 23. Compare traditional switch with SDN enabled switch in terms of handling forwarding decisions. *   Traditional Switch/Router: Forwarding decisions are typically destination-based, meaning the device examines the destination IP address of an arriving packet to index a local forwarding table. The control-plane logic (routing algorithms) and the data-plane forwarding functions are implemented monolithically within each individual device. *   SDN Enabled Switch: Forwarding is generalized using a \"match-plus-action\" paradigm. The switch can match packets based on various header fields from multiple protocol layers (link, network, and transport layers). Crucially, the forwarding tables (flow tables) are computed and distributed by a logically centralized remote controller that is physically separate from the switching hardware. 24. Why CSMA/CD is not appropriate for full-duplex Ethernet environment? CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) is designed to manage a shared broadcast medium where collisions occur when multiple stations transmit simultaneously. In a full-duplex Ethernet environment, stations are typically connected via a switch that provides dedicated capacity for both transmission and reception. Because full-duplex switches coordinate transmissions so that a switch and a node can send frames to each other at the same time without interference, there are no collisions in the channel. Consequently, the CSMA/CD algorithm—intended specifically to detect and recover from collisions—is unnecessary and no longer needed. *** Analogy for SDN vs. Traditional Switching: Think of a traditional switch like a driver who has to stop at every intersection, look at a local map, and decide which way to turn based on their own knowledge. An SDN-enabled switch is like a train following tracks laid out by a centralized dispatcher; the train doesn't need to know the whole map, it just follows the specific \"match-plus-action\" instructions sent from the central office. 1.\tDifferentiate between Router and Gateway. 2.

Suppose hosts A and B are assigned the same IP address on the Ethernet, on which ARP is used, B starts up after A. What will happen? 23. Mention the salient features of IPv6. 24. List out any three issues in the data link layer. 1. Differentiate between Router and Gateway A router is a network-layer (Layer 3) packet switch that determines the end-to-end paths packets take from a source to a destination by using a routing algorithm and a forwarding table. It functions by relaying data from one network to another while remaining oblivious to transport-layer connections. In contrast, a gateway is an intermediary program that acts as a protocol translator, often providing access to resources stored on non-HTTP systems (e.g., translating HTTP to FTP) or acting as a portal through network firewalls. Unlike a traditional router, a gateway receives requests as if it were the original server for the requested resource, and the client may be unaware it is communicating with one. 2. Encapsulation and Decapsulation through 3 Routers If a packet must traverse three routers, encapsulation will take place four times and decapsulation will take place four times. The source host performs the initial encapsulation down to the link-layer frame. Each of the three routers must decapsulate the incoming link-layer frame to the network layer (IP) to examine the destination address, and then re-encapsulate the datagram into a new link-layer frame for the next hop. Finally, the destination host performs the last decapsulation of the frame up to the application-layer message. 3. Issues in the Data Link Layer Three primary issues addressed by the data link layer are: *   Framing: The process of encapsulating a network-layer datagram within a link-layer frame, including a header and trailer, before transmission. *   Link Access: Managing how multiple nodes share a broadcast link through a medium access control (MAC) protocol to coordinate transmissions and resolve conflicts. *   Error Detection and Correction: Implementing mechanisms to detect and fix bit errors caused by signal attenuation or electromagnetic noise using techniques like CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check). 4. IEEE 802.3 Frame Format The IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet) frame consists of the following sequential fields: *   Preamble (7 octets): Alternating 0s and 1s to synchronize the receiver's clock. *   Start Frame Delimiter (SFD) (1 octet): Indicates the actual start of the frame. *   Destination MAC Address (6 bytes): The physical address of the receiving adapter. *   Source MAC Address (6 bytes): The physical address of the transmitting adapter. *   Length/Type (2 bytes): Indicates the length of the data field or the specific upper-layer protocol (e.g., IP). *   Data/LLC Data (46 to 1500 bytes): Carries the network-layer datagram; padding is added if it is less than 46 bytes. *   Pad (variable): Added to ensure the frame meets the minimum length requirements for collision detection. *   Frame Check Sequence (FCS) (4 bytes): A 32-bit CRC used by the receiver to detect bit errors in the frame. 5. Differentiate between ARP and DHCP Protocol ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is used to resolve an IP address to a MAC address for nodes located on the same local subnet, acting as a \"plug-and-play\" tool that builds mapping tables automatically. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a client-server protocol that allows a newly arrived host to automatically obtain an IP address from a network server. While ARP handles local physical addressing, DHCP provides a full network configuration, including the host's IP address, subnet mask, the address of the default gateway, and the local DNS server address. 6. Class/Type of IP Addresses *   a. 134.53.0.0: This is a Class B address. (The range for Class B network addresses is 128 to 191 in the first octet). *   b. 1.78.9.23: This is a Class A address. (The range for Class A network addresses is 1 to 126 in the first octet). 7. How TCP Provides Reliable Data Delivery TCP provides reliable data delivery by transforming the unreliable \"best-effort\" service of the IP layer into a service that ensures data is uncorrupted, without gaps, and in sequence. It justifies this reliability through several mechanisms: checksums for detecting bit errors, sequence numbers to reorder packets and detect duplicates, acknowledgments (ACKs) from the receiver to confirm successful delivery, and timers that trigger the retransmission of segments if an acknowledgment is not received within a specific timeout interval. 8. Various Parts of HTTP The HTTP message structure consists of the following components: *   Request Line (Request) / Status Line (Response): The first line indicating the method (e.g., GET, POST) and URL for requests, or the success/error code for responses. *   General Header: Fields applicable to both requests and responses that do not apply to the data being transferred (e.g., Date, Connection). *   Request/Response Header: Specific headers containing information about the client's capabilities or the server's software. *   Entity Header: Metadata regarding the resource identified by the request and the entity body (e.g., Content-Type, Content-Length). *   Entity Body: The actual payload of the message, containing the resource data such as HTML text or binary image data. 9. Open Source Network Monitoring Tools *   Wireshark: A free, open-source packet sniffer and protocol analyzer that allows users to capture and examine protocol messages in real time. *   Nmap: A widely used public-domain port-scanning tool that can discover open ports, network applications, and operating system versions. *   SONiC: A Linux-based open-source initiative for networking operating systems used in large-scale environments. 10. Software Defined Network (SDN) Software Defined Networking (SDN) is an architecture characterized by the separation of the data plane and the control plane. In this paradigm, the network control functions are moved external to the physical switches and implemented in a logically centralized remote controller (software). Forwarding in SDN is flow-based, allowing packet switches to match packets using values from across different protocol layers (Link, Network, and Transport) rather than just destination IP addresses. This makes the network highly programmable through control applications that can manage routing, load balancing, and firewalling by distributing flow tables to the hardware. *** Analogy for Encapsulation: Imagine a letter (the data) being placed inside a series of envelopes. The first envelope is for the recipient's office (Transport), the second is for their building (Network), and the third is for the delivery truck (Link). Every time the letter reaches a major sorting center (a Router), workers must open the outer truck envelope to read the building address on the inner envelope, then place it into a new truck envelope for the next leg of the trip. Only the final recipient opens every envelope to read the actual message. 11. Two high-bandwidth applications Based on the sources, two applications used on a daily basis that require very high bandwidth from the network are video streaming (such as YouTube, Netflix, and Amazon Prime) and video conferencing (such as Skype, Facetime, and Google Hangouts). 12. Encapsulation and decapsulation through 2 routers If a packet must go through two routers, encapsulation will take place three times and decapsulation will take place three times. *   Source Host: Encapsulates the application message into a transport segment, then a network datagram, and finally a link-layer frame. *   Router 1: Decapsulates the frame to read the network datagram (IP), then re-encapsulates it into a new link-layer frame for the next hop. *   Router 2: Decapsulates the frame to read the datagram, then re-encapsulates it for the final destination. *   Destination Host: Performs the final decapsulation of the frame and datagram to deliver the message to the application. 13. Differentiate between a modem, a switch, and a router *   Modem: A transmitter/receiver that converts digital bit streams into analog signals for transmission over analog media (like telephone lines) and converts them back into digital format at the receiving end. *   Switch: A link-layer device that forwards frames based on MAC addresses; it is typically used in access networks to interconnect multiple devices within a single local network. *   Router: A network-layer device that forwards packets based on destination IP addresses; its primary role is to determine the end-to-end paths between different networks. 14. RTT and Bandwidth Utilization Calculation *   Given: Data size ($L$) = 1000 bytes (8000 bits); distance ($d$) = 10,000 km ($10^7$ m); link bandwidth ($R$) = 2 Gbps ($2 \\times 10^9$ bps); ACK size = 100 bytes (800 bits). *   Step 1: Calculate Propagation Delay ($t_{prop}$): Using a standard propagation speed in fiber ($2 \\times 10^8$ m/s), $t_{prop} = 10,000,000 / 200,000,000 = 0.05$ seconds (50 ms). *   Step 2: Calculate Transmission Delays ($t_{trans}$):     *   Data $t_{trans} = 8000 / (2 \\times 10^9) = 0.000004$ s ($4 \\mu s$).     *   ACK $t_{trans} = 800 / (2 \\times 10^9) = 0.0000004$ s ($0.4 \\mu s$). *   Step 3: Calculate RTT: $RTT = \\text{Data } t_{trans} + t_{prop} + \\text{ACK } t_{trans} + t_{prop} = 4\\mu s + 50ms + 0.4\\mu s + 50ms = \\mathbf{100.0044 \\text{ ms}}$. *   Step 4: Segments for 100% utilization: This is the bandwidth-delay product: $(2 \\times 10^9 \\text{ bps} \\times 0.1000044 \\text{ s}) / 8000 \\text{ bits/segment} \\approx \\mathbf{25,001 \\text{ segments}}$. 15. HTTP Status Response Codes *   200 OK: The request succeeded and information is returned in the response. *   301 Moved Permanently: The requested object has been permanently moved to a new URL specified in the Location header. *   400 Bad Request: A generic error indicating the server could not understand the request. *   401 Unauthorized: Indicates an authentication error (required but missing or invalid). *   505 HTTP Version Not Supported: The requested protocol version is not supported by the server. 16. 3-way vs. 2-way Handshaking in TCP The 3-way handshake (SYN $\\rightarrow$ SYN-ACK $\\rightarrow$ ACK) is required to ensure that both sides have established sequence numbers and are ready to communicate, preventing problems caused by obsolete segments from previous connections. A 2-way handshake is insufficient because a delayed duplicate SYN from an old connection could arrive at a server, which would then open a half-open connection for a request that is no longer valid. 17. TCP connections for downloading 4 files via FTP To download 4 files, 5 TCP connections must be established: 1.  One persistent control connection for the entire session to exchange commands (like user IDs and passwords)."}]}

It functions by relaying data from one network to another while remaining oblivious to transport-layer connections. In contrast, a gateway is an intermediary program that acts as a protocol translator, often providing access to resources stored on non-HTTP systems (e.g., translating HTTP to FTP) or acting as a portal through network firewalls. Unlike a traditional router, a gateway receives requests as if it were the original server for the requested resource, and the client may be unaware it is communicating with one."}]}
