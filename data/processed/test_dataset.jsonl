In a full-duplex Ethernet environment, stations are typically connected via a switch that provides dedicated capacity for both transmission and reception. Because full-duplex switches coordinate transmissions so that a switch and a node can send frames to each other at the same time without interference, there are no collisions in the channel. Consequently, the CSMA/CD algorithm—intended specifically to detect and recover from collisions—is unnecessary and no longer needed."}]}
