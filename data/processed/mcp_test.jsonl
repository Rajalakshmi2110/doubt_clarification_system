{"input": "[QUESTION]\nWhat is the main difference between fiber optic cables and twisted pair cables in terms of data transmission?\n\n[CONTEXT]\nThe following characteristics distinguish optical fiber from twisted pair or\ncoaxial cable:\n• Greater capacity: The potential bandwidth, and hence data rate, of optical\nfiber is immense; data rates of hundreds of Gbps over tens of kilometers have\nbeen demonstrated.\n\nThe advantages of optical fiber over twisted pair and coaxial cable become\nmore compelling as the demand for all types of information (voice, data, image,\nvideo) increases. Transmission Characteristics Optical fiber transmits a signal-encoded beam\nof light by means of total internal reflection.\n\nSome people\neven felt that fiber-optic technology would completely replace twisted pair. But twisted pair did not give up so easily. Modern twisted-pair technology,\nsuch as category 6a cable, can achieve data rates of 10 Gbps for distances\nup to a hundred meters. In the end, twisted pair has emerged as the\ndominant solution for high-speed LAN networking.\n\nData rates for LANs using twisted pair today range from 10\nMbps to 10 Gbps. The data rates that can be achieved depend on the\nthickness of the wire and the distance between transmitter and receiver. When fiber-optic technology emerged in the 1980s, many people\ndisparaged twisted pair because of its relatively low bit rates.\n\n[INSTRUCTION]\nAnswer the question academically using only the given context.", "output": "The main difference lies in their transmission capacity and immunity to interference. Optical fiber offers immense potential bandwidth (supporting hundreds of Gbps over tens of kilometers) and is immune to electromagnetic interference, crosstalk, and noise.
