When a bit arrives from one interface, the hub simply re-creates and transmits that bit onto all other interfaces, creating a single broadcast LAN where only one station can successfully transmit at a time. If two stations transmit simultaneously, a collision occurs, and the nodes must retransmit using CSMA/CD. Switch Functionality: A switch is a link-layer (layer 2) device that switches incoming frames to specific output lines based on the destination MAC address. Unlike a hub, a switch is collision-less; it buffers frames and never transmits more than one frame on a segment at any time, effectively creating separate collision domains for each connected station. Influence on Performance: In a hub-based network, all stations share the total capacity of the medium (e.g., 10 Mbps). In a switched LAN, each station can enjoy a dedicated capacity equal to the original LAN speed, allowing for a much higher aggregate throughput (the sum of all interface rates).", "metadata": {"question_id": 1, "topic": "Network Hardware", "difficulty": "medium", "retrieved_chunks": 4, "source_dataset": "data\\dataset\\maximum_questions.json"}}\n{"input": "[QUESTION]\nHow TCP ensures reliability with an unreliable lower layer service?\n\n[CONTEXT]\nFor example,\nin the transport layer, the fundamental issues include reliable\ncommunication over an unreliable network layer, connection establishment/\nteardown and handshaking, congestion and flow control, and multiplexing.\\n\\nIf all the links in the Internet were to provide reliable delivery\nservice, would the TCP reliable delivery service be redundant?
