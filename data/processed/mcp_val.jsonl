UDP provides an unreliable data transfer\nservice—that is, when a process sends a message into a UDP socket, UDP\nprovides no guarantee that the message will ever reach the receiving\nprocess. Furthermore, messages that do arrive at the receiving process may\narrive out of order.\n\nWithout\nperforming any handshaking with the UDP entity running on the destination\nend system, the host-side UDP adds header fields to the message and passes\nthe resulting segment to the network layer.

The DNS application at the querying host then waits for a reply to its query.\n\nWe encourage you to refer back to Section 2.1, which includes an\noverview of the UDP service model, and to Section 2.7.1, which discusses\nsocket programming using UDP.
