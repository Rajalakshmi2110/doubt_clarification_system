    "question": "Compare the functionality of a hub and a switch in relation to collision domains and specify their influence on overall network performance.",
    "answer": "Hub Functionality: A hub is a physical-layer device that acts on individual bits rather than frames. When a bit arrives from one interface, the hub simply re-creates and transmits that bit onto all other interfaces, creating a single broadcast LAN where only one station can successfully transmit at a time. If two stations transmit simultaneously, a collision occurs, and the nodes must retransmit using CSMA/CD. Switch Functionality: A switch is a link-layer (layer 2) device that switches incoming frames to specific output lines based on the destination MAC address. Unlike a hub, a switch is collision-less; it buffers frames and never transmits more than one frame on a segment at any time, effectively creating separate collision domains for each connected station. Influence on Performance: In a hub-based network, all stations share the total capacity of the medium (e.g., 10 Mbps). In a switched LAN, each station can enjoy a dedicated capacity equal to the original LAN speed, allowing for a much higher aggregate throughput (the sum of all interface rates).",

Pseudoternary: Binary 1 is represented by no line signal, while binary 0 is represented by alternating positive and negative pulses.

    "question": "How the 3-way handshaking process is differ from 2-way, connection establishment in TCP?",
    "answer": "The 3-way handshake (SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK) is required to ensure that both sides have established sequence numbers and are ready to communicate, preventing problems caused by obsolete segments from previous connections. A 2-way handshake is insufficient because a delayed duplicate SYN from an old connection could arrive at a server, which would then open a half-open connection for a request that is no longer valid.",

    "answer": "To download 4 files, 5 TCP connections must be established: One persistent control connection for the entire session to exchange commands (like user IDs and passwords). Four separate data connections, one for each individual file transfer.",

    "question": "Why RCC of Anna university getting your MAC address instead of IP Address in Wi-Fi registration Form?",
    "answer": "Universities and carriers collect the MAC address because it is a permanent, flat identifier associated with the hardware (the \"social security number\" of the device). In contrast, IP addresses are transient and change whenever a mobile device moves to a new subnet or has its lease expire via DHCP. The MAC address allows the system to identify the specific physical device regardless of its current network location.",

    "question": "What is silly window syndrome in TCP?",
    "answer": "Silly Window Syndrome is a phenomenon that causes extremely poor performance in TCP when data is exchanged in very small segments. It occurs if the sender transmits data in small chunks or if the receiver advertises small increments in window size (credit) after clearing its buffer, causing the overhead of the headers to become significantly larger than the actual data being transferred.",

    "question": "Differentiate between circuit switching and packet switching.",
    "answer": "Circuit Switching: Establishes a dedicated communications path with reserved resources (bandwidth and buffers); it provides a guaranteed constant data rate and involves no queuing delay once the circuit is set up. Packet Switching: Uses resources on demand without reservation; data is sent in discrete packets that are queued at nodes, which can lead to variable delay or loss, but allows for more efficient sharing of link capacity.",

    "question": "Suppose hosts A and B are assigned the same IP address on the Ethernet, on which ARP is used, B starts up after A. What will happen?",
    "answer": "When Host B starts up after Host A with the same IP address, a conflict occurs within the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) mechanism. Typically, a newly arriving host may send an ARP request to resolve its own IP address to ensure it is unique; if Host B does this, Host A will receive the broadcast and may respond or log an error. If an external host sends an ARP query for that shared IP, both Host A and Host B will respond with their respective (different) MAC addresses. This leads to inconsistent ARP tables in other network nodes, a situation where the \"winning\" MAC address in a remote cache depends on which response arrived last, effectively disrupting reliable communication for both hosts.",

    "question": "Mention the salient features of IPv6.",
    "answer": "The sources identify several key enhancements in IPv6 over IPv4: Expanded Addressing: IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses (compared to 32-bit), providing an effectively inexhaustible supply of unique identifiers. Streamlined Header: It features a fixed-length 40-byte header with fewer fields (8 vs 12 in IPv4), which allows for faster processing by routers. Flow Labeling: A 20-bit field allows a source to label packets for special handling (e.g., real-time service) by routers. Improved Options Mechanism: Options are moved to extension headers located between the IP and transport headers, simplifying the main header. No Router Fragmentation: IPv6 prohibits fragmentation at intermediate routers; it must be performed by the source host, which increases forwarding efficiency. Anycast Addresses: A new type of address that allows a packet to be delivered to the \"nearest\" member of a group of functional interfaces.",

Link Access: Coordinating how multiple nodes share a broadcast medium to prevent or manage collisions. Error Control: Implementing mechanisms to detect and potentially correct bit errors introduced by signal attenuation or noise. Flow Control: Ensuring a fast sender does not overwhelm a slow receiver's buffer capacity.",
